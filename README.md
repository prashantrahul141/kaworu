# Kaworu

A WIP Unix-like AArch64 kernel

## Building

If you use nix, `nix develop` sets up everything you will need in order to
build and run the kernel under Qemu.

Building requires the following packages:

```sh
clang
lld

limine # binaries, used in creation of iso image
xorriso # to create iso image

qemu # to run
gnumake # ofcourse
python313Packages.kconfiglib

# llvm # not required, but contains useful tools like objdump, objcopy
# gdb # for debugging
# bear # if you want to generate compile_commands.json
```

Then generate a config using:

```sh
# Use the default config
make defconfig
# Or configure the kernel yourself and save it
make menuconfig
```

Then build the kernel

```sh
make
```

## Running

I have yet to test this on actual hardware, I have only tested this on Qemu
under the `virt` platform.

Since AArch64 only supports UEFI and not bios, you will need to provide UEFI firmware for Qemu.
You can just download the `full-release` from the [releases page](https://github.com/prashantrahul141/kaworu/releases) as it contains
both a built ISO Image and firmware you need to emulate under Qemu.

You can also download the firmware from the releases
page of:
https://github.com/osdev0/edk2-ovmf-stable-bins/releases/

Then set `UEFI_FIRMWARE` env pointing directly to the firmware.

This is done automatically if you're using nix.

run under Qemu:

```sh
make run
```
